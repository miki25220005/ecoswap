# ecoswap
EcoSwap is a platform that encourages people to reduce plastic waste by earning points when they recycle or donate. Users can redeem these points for eco-friendly products, while businesses can list their goods and receive full payment. The system supports delivery partners, awareness content, and a leveling system to reward active users.
